### Design

#### Colour Scheme

- The three main colours used were Red #EF0001, White #FFFFFF and Oxford Blue #172030. These colours were taken from the Arsenal FC logo to ensure they are official Arsenal FC colours. This allows the site to be instantly identifiable by football fans. 

- The kick off button is coloured in Metallic Sunburst #9D8349 and the background of the page is coloured in Cultured #F1F2F3. Both these colours are taken from the official Arsenal FC website and stick with the main theme.

#### Typography

- Source Sans Pro is used throughout the site. It is a sharp, clear and crisp font making it easy to read. It is similar to FF Meta which is the font used on the official Arsenal FC site.

- The site uses uppercase for titles and buttons and capitalisation for all other text. This enables readability and allows the buttons to be easily identified.  

- The font has a sans-serif backup.
